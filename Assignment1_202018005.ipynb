K. Mehrotra.\\n\\n Apart from the unit-linked pension plan, the schemes would include a childrens plan and another similar to Jeevan Shree for high net-worth individuals.\\n\\n Mehrotra acknowledged that the response to LICs existing pension schemes was not very encouraging. This is because of lack of awareness among employees in rural and the unorganised sector, said Mehrotra.\\n\\n However, the company is planning to increase awareness among these sections of people through a number of programmes to be addressed by agents and marketing people, Mehrotra added.\\n\\n Till August 14, the corporation had sold a total of 22,212 pension policies with a premium income of Rs 40 crore.\\n\\n In the eastern zone, LIC had sold 4600 policies in the period between April and August 14, 2004-05, with a total premium income of Rs 6.15 crore. \\n\\n During the financial year 2003-04, LIC had sold a total of 3.26 lakh pension policies with a premium income of Rs 468 crore in which the share of the eastern zone was 63,233 policies and Rs 86.40 crore in premium income.\\n\\n Mehrotra said that the corporation would give special emphasis on increasing distribution channels to maintain its market share and also increase the popularity of pension schemes.\\n\\n LIC markets its products through 3624 outlets of banks namely Uco Bank, Corporation Bank, Allahabad Bank, West Bengal State Co-operative Bank and have 135 licensed corporate agents who market the products through 163 outlets.\\n\\n As on August 15, 2004, the eastern zone had earned premium income of Rs 410.14 crore by selling 14.05 lakh policies recording a growth of 38.82 per cent and 11.22 per cent in premium and policies respectively.\\n\\n Bima Plus fetched premium of Rs 51.81 crore and seven other important new plans earned premium of Rs 64.86 crore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n1040904_business_story_3716127.utf8\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Telegraph - Calcutta : Business\\n\\n RBI fuels rally in bank stocks \\n\\n OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT \\n\\n Mumbai, Sept. 3: Bank shares rallied on the stock exchanges today after the Reserve Bank of India relaxed the limits on banks bond investments yesterday. The RBI move is expected to have a positive impact on the balance-sheet of public sector banks as it would cushion them against falling government security prices.\\n\\n The RBI has allowed banks to exceed the 25 per cent limit on their investments under the held-to-maturity (HTM) category provided the excess comprises only statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) securities. \\n\\n The central bank also stipulated that the total SLR securities held in the HTM category should not be more than 25 per cent of their demand and time liabilities (DTL) as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight.\\n\\n According to analysts, the RBI move will protect the balance-sheets of nationalised banks from the impact of falling government security prices. Nationalised banks are heavy investors in government securities and their investments exceed the minimum level of 25 per cent of their deposits.\\n\\n Presently there are three categories under which banks can hold securities. These include HTM, available-for-sale and held-for-trading categories. \\n\\n The RBI regulations stipulate that banks must mark to market their holdings in the available-for-sale and held-for-trading categories.\\n\\n Market circles said bank stocks, which have been under pressure in the recent past on concerns over the impact of a likely rise in interest rates, witnessed brisk buying with investors chasing nationalised banks. \\n\\n At the BSE, State Bank of India (SBI) was the most actively traded counter with the highest turnover of Rs 116.57 crore. SBI scrip firmed up by Rs 10.15 to Rs 462.15. Bank of Baroda also gained Rs 11 to finish at Rs 174.80. Corporation Bank shares were up by Rs 8 to end at Rs 259.90 and Canara Bank gained by Rs 3 to finish at Rs 141.40. \\n\\n The BSE Bankex was one of the leading indices in the exchange as it gained by around 33 points. After opening at 2533.78, it shot to a days high of 2574 before closing at 2570.41.\\n\\n The RBIs decision to raise the investment limits has come at a time when most of the banks have witnessed their trading gains evaporate in the first quarter of the current fiscal due to sustained drop in prices of government securities.\\n\\n Treasury circles feel that the central bank is preparing the banking sector for an interest rate hike in the months to come. So far the RBI has desisted from raising key rates and the benchmark bank rate is still at a three decade low. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n1040905_business_story_3720106.utf8\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Telegraph - Calcutta : Business\\n\\n RBI breather for urban co-op banks\\n\\n OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT \\n\\n Mumbai, Sept. 4: The Reserve Bank has relaxed loan impairment norms for urban cooperative banks. The 90-day norm relating to asset classification and provisioning will now be applicable to gold loans and small loans up to Rs 1 lakh only from the financial year ending March 31, 2007.\\n\\n Till then these loans would be governed by the 180-day impairment norm.\\n\\n Earlier, the central bank had advised UCBs to apply the 90-day norm from the financial year ending March 31, 2005.\\n\\n The decision was based on the representations by UCBs, a Reserve Bank release said here today.\\n\\n RBI governor Y. V. Reddy had held meeting with federations of co-operative banks on September 2 where UCBs sought relaxation in these norms.\\n\\n In the meeting, specific suggestions were placed. These included a proposal to modify prudential regulations, including deferring the application of 90-day norm, a plan to exclude gold loans and loans below Rs 1 lakh from these norms, and to rationalise procedures governing maintenance of cash reserve ratio (CRR). \\n\\n The representatives also requested that the forthcoming Basel II norms are applied in a modified form to suit their localised nature. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n1040907_business_story_3725187.utf8\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Telegraph - Calcutta : Business\\n\\n Advisers to help WBIDC sell bad assets \\n\\n SUTANUKA GHOSAL\\n\\n Calcutta, Sept. 6: West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) will appoint advisers to help it dispose of assets under liquidation.\\n\\n The decision was taken at the corporations board meeting held last month. There are 41 such assets under liquidation and WBIDC wants to generate revenues from them.\\n\\n The corporation will soon float a tender inviting bids from advisers, who will be paid on a commission basis.\\n\\n There are huge assets of non-performing companies under liquidation. WBIDC has exposure in these companies. We want to unlock these idle assets and enhance revenue flow. The advisers will help us in selling these assets. The corporation will pay them good commissions, said a senior WBIDC official.\\n\\n WBIDC has consciously decided to increase its standard assets in order to reduce the net non-performing asset and net asset ratio.\\n\\n The corporation is planning to increase its exposure in the forthcoming projects. In the last couple of years, WBIDC had not invested heavily, the last major being Rs 12 crore in Ramrupai Steel.\\n\\n Sources said the corporation may increase its exposure to Rs 40 crore in certain projects. At present, there are three steel and a cement project on WBIDCs platter.\\n\\n However, the investment will all be in the form of loans. WBIDC will not invest in equity in a big way. Unless it is a very big project, WBIDC will not pick up equity. We will buy 11 per cent of Kulpi Port, which is being developed by the Bengal government, P amp; and Bengal Port, sources added.\\n\\n The corporation may also buy a stake in Tatas coke oven project, which is slated to come up in Haldia. \\n\\n In 2003-04, WBIDC had disbursed Rs 80 crore as loans. This year the target is Rs 100 crore. \\n\\n The corporation is also trying to cut its bad assets. In 2003-04, WBIDC had trimmed its bad or non-performing assets (NPAs) by Rs 57 crore. This year the target is Rs 60 crore. \\n\\n WBIDC has decided to raise money against its own receivables as part of the securitisation exercise. \\n\\n ICICI Bank has agreed to provide Rs 25 crore as loan against receivables at a coupon rate of 6.95 per cent. The corporation will lend this money at a higher interest of 9.5 per cent thereby augmenting revenue for it. \\n\\n State Bank of India as well as UTI Bank is keen to provide loans against receivables at an interest of 6.5 per cent. \\n\\n IDBI is also keen to provide us loans at a much lower interest of 5.6 per cent. We are in talks with them, sources added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n1040907_business_story_3725087.utf8\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Telegraph - Calcutta : Business\\n\\n All eyes on Greenspan this week\\n\\n Greenspan: In focus\\n\\n London, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspans testimony on Capitol Hill midweek will be the main draw for global financial markets this week in the absence of significant data either side of the Atlantic, analysts said.\\n\\n Ruthlessly put, Green- spans testimony is the only real factor that matters next week for global foreign exchange and debt markets, said Don Smith, economist at ICAP in London.\\n\\n Greenspan will speak before the House of Representatives budget committee next Wednesday.\\n\\n The US August non-farm payrolls report on Friday preserved the prospect of a rising Federal funds rate and analysts said it would lend support to the central bankers outlook for the worlds biggest economy.\\n\\n Although employers added only 144,000 to payrolls in August, just below a median forecast of 150,000, there were upward revisions to June and July data and debt markets dived after the figures.\\n\\n The non-farm payrolls dont change anything but they do provide Greenspan with more ammunition to say the economy is rebounding. It will leave scope for further tightening of rates, said Marc Ostwald, bond broker at Monument Securities in London.\\n\\n US rates were last hiked by 25 basis points to 1.50 per cent on August 10. Before mid-year, they had nestled at 1 per cent for a year and were at their lowest since the mid-1950s.\\n\\n Greenspan will say that tightening is necessary to remove the unnecessary accommodation given to the market before which has resulted in negative real interest rates, he added.\\n\\n Since his testimony on July 20, when he noted payrolls had averaged 200,000 per month over the past six months, the average reading slowed to 106,000 in the three months to July, said a research note on Friday from HSBC Bank.\\n\\n But Greenspan is likely to blame recent disappointment on the high oil price. And the recent pullback in energy prices could give him breathing room...to remain growth bullish, the note added. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
